			<p class="Articletext"> Hello, and welcome to the beginning of an ongoing series of increasingly bewildering Mathematical ramblings that attempt to clearly and concisely explain abstract mathematical concepts; specifically those that are in one or more ways relevant to program development and the technical world as a whole. </p>
			<p class="Articletext"> This is page 0, which will serve as a kind of dynamic glossary that I will be constantly updating as new ground is covered. Here I will introduce the concepts that are essential to any Mathematical discourse, the stitches that hold the very fabric of Mathematics together. This page will be very frequently referenced going forward, but I'll be kind enough to provide hyperlinks where needed; so it's not necessary to familiarize yourself with all of these concepts at once, unless you want to of course: I won't stop you. </p>
			<p class="Articletext"> Let's get started. </p>
			
			<h1 id="symbols" class="Articletext"> Numbers, letters, and more letters </h1>
			
			<p class="Articletext"> While the study of Mathematics does heavily feature our favourite 10 numerals, that's not what it's all about. Quite often we'll find ourselves needing a placeholder; a character that can represent an object (not necessarily a single number) without assigning a specific value to it. Usually we need these because we don't know the value or the value changes, but sometimes we'll need to use them for known static values that can't be written out in their entirety. In a programming context, you can think of these as variables and constants, respectively. While these placeholders could be anything (you could even use pictionary style graphical interpretations of your desired quantities if you're insane), I'd like it if they were characters that are included in the sans-serif Verdana font family. </p>
			
			<p class="Articletext"> Fortunately for me, the most widely accepted Mathematical notations rarely use anything outside the Latin and Greek alphabets. </p>

			<h2 class="Articletext"> Traditionally used symbols and their purposes </h2>
			
			<p class="Articletext"> After centuries of usage in a wide variety of fields and disciplines, some of our Mathematical alphabet has been typecast; often being deployed in a specfic context that has become Mathematical tradition for most. Of course, there are also certain symbols that have a universal meaning, having been allocated to constants of extreme importance and widespread significance. You might recognise one in the figure above. </p>
			
			<h2 class="Articletext">  π (pi), e, and i </h2>
			
			<p class="Articletext"> The three pillars that show up just about everywhere you might be expected to do anything even slightly Mathematical.</br></br><b>π</b> is defined by geometry - the infamous ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.</br></br><b>e</b> is a product of calculus - which is most simply described as the study of change and best explained elsewhere. It's used to define the natural logarithm, as well as the trigonometric sine and cosine.</br></br><b>i</b> is the result of imagination - the not real positive square root of negative one, often referred to as the imaginary number. It has no numerical approximation, and is best thought of as a number in and of itself, as opposed to a symbolic representation.</br></br> Three hugely important numbers, each warranting their own special symbol in our Mathematical alphabet. Wouldn't it be crazy if they were all somehow connected? </p>

			<h2 class="Articletext"> δΔ (delta) and ε (epsilon): small numbers and change </h2>
			
			<p class="Articletext"> What if, instead of wanting a variable for a specific value, we wanted one that represented an arbitrarily small number? A number that is basically 0 - but not quite equal to it?</br></br><b>δ</b> is typically used to indicate infinitesimally small changes in a quantity. For example, δr could refer to a tiny change made to a circle's radius. It frequently appears in calculus derivations.</br></br><b>Δ</b> is used to denote a measured change in a quantity, often by placing it before another variable. For example, ΔT might refer to a change in temperature.</br></br><b>ε</b> is typically used to represent a number that is arbitrarily close to 0, appearing regularly in analysis fields: the study of intervals and limits.</p>
